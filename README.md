# INSY662-DataMining-FinalProject
In this school project, my team and I created a prediction algorithm in order to predict house prices in Ottawa.
We explored many data preprocessing techniques, models (linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting, etc), and hyperparameter tuning. In the end, we made predictions on house prices. We also explored different visualization techniques such as price heat maps through html code.
